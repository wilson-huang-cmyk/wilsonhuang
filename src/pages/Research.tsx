          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Authored and published a #1 Amazon Bestseller on pharmaceutical industry corruption, earning endorsements from academics at York and Cambridge and praise from over 260+ buyers.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Public discourse surrounding the pharmaceutical industry and its role in global health crises is often polarized and lacks a clear, evidence-based analysis accessible to a general audience.
          </p>

        <div className="project-section">
          <h2>My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I undertook a rigorous research process to write "Big Pharmamania," a book that breaks down complex legal and ethical issues into a compelling narrative. It combines business ethics, scientific analysis, and social commentary to expose monopolistic practices and advocate for systemic reform in public health.

        <div className="project-section">
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>
            As the author, I managed the entire project lifecycle, from initial concept to publication. My research and writing were assisted by two distinguished academic mentors â€” one holding an M.A. Hons from St. John's College, Cambridge with over 25 years of experience in history and literature, and another with a Ph.D. in Philosophy from York University and more than a decade of expertise in ethics, political theory, and law. I personally handled the manuscript editing, Amazon KDP publishing, and distribution.
